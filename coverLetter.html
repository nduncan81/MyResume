        <p>Dear Hiring Manager</p>

        <p>Thank you for taking the time to review my resume and application for the position of Director of IT User Engagement at Georgia Southern.  I have been working in IT field since I graduated from Georgia Southern in 2003.  </p>

        <p>I am looking for a challenging opportunity to grow in the IT field and I feel like a Director is the next step.  In my current position here at Gwinnett County Public Schools, I am a hands on leader with my team where I actively help them with projects or assist them with getting in touch with the right people to get their job done successfully.  We work on tight deadlines and we work together as a team to build each others skills up so that we can program, develop and communicate to users and other tech teams (hardware, stress testing) effectively.  In my career I have a strong programming background but I also communicate and collaborate effectivly with end users that are not as tech savvy.</p>
        <p>I have a combined 18 years in the IT field working in K-12 Education and in manufacturing. I work with a very diverse team to build and support multiple business processes throughout my time at Gwinnett County Public Schools</p>
        <p>The reason I am attracted to this position is the ability to grow my skills and accept a new challenge at a University that I graduated from. Also in my current role, I believe I currently meet the Abilites, Knowledge, and Skills mentioned in the Job Description for this position.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your consideration and time.  I am looking forward to learning more about this position.  Also, this would be an exciting opportuntiy to be a part of the Georgia Southern community again.  </p>

        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>Nathan Duncan</p>
